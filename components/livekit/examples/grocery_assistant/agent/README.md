# Grocery Assistant

Assistant for checking prices and answering product questions powered by Gemini Live. For products sold by weight, the
agent can read the weight on the scale attached to the client (ESP32) via RPC.

## Product Database

Known products the agent is allowed to answers questions about are defined in [_database.py_](./src/database.py).
This is provided for demonstration purposes; in a production agent, you would likely access products from a database.

## Dev Setup

Clone the repository and install dependencies to a virtual environment:

```console
cd agent-starter-python
uv sync
```

Sign up for [LiveKit Cloud](https://cloud.livekit.io/) then set up the environment by copying `.env.example` to `.env.local` and filling in the required keys:

- `LIVEKIT_URL`
- `LIVEKIT_API_KEY`
- `LIVEKIT_API_SECRET`
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY`

You can load the LiveKit environment automatically using the [LiveKit CLI](https://docs.livekit.io/home/cli/cli-setup):

```bash
lk cloud auth
lk app env -w -d .env.local
```

## Run the agent

Before your first run, you must download certain models such as [Silero VAD](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/turns/vad/) and the [LiveKit turn detector](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/turns/turn-detector/):

```console
uv run python src/agent.py download-files
```

Next, run this command to speak to your agent directly in your terminal:

```console
uv run python src/agent.py console
```

To run the agent for use with a frontend or telephony, use the `dev` command:

```console
uv run python src/agent.py dev
```

In production, use the `start` command:

```console
uv run python src/agent.py start
```

## Frontend & Telephony

This agent is intended for use with the _grocery_assistant_ example for the ESP32 SDK since the agent makes an RCP call to read the attached scale. However,
it can be easily modified to work with another [frontend](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/start/frontend/) and/or [telephony](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/start/telephony/).

## Deploying to production

This project is production-ready and includes a working `Dockerfile`. To deploy it to LiveKit Cloud or another environment, see the [deploying to production](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/ops/deployment/) guide.

## Self-hosted LiveKit

You can also self-host LiveKit instead of using LiveKit Cloud. See the [self-hosting](https://docs.livekit.io/home/self-hosting/) guide for more information. If you choose to self-host, you'll need to also use [model plugins](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/models/#plugins) instead of LiveKit Inference and will need to remove the [LiveKit Cloud noise cancellation](https://docs.livekit.io/home/cloud/noise-cancellation/) plugin.
